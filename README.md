# Pig Latin Translator
The [Pig Latin Translator](https://moniquejb.github.io/pig-latin-translator/) was the first website I ever built (2021)- so go easy on me, it's far from perfect! :sweat_smile: Even with it's imperfections, I learnt a lot about coding at that part of my journey through this project. It was the point where, after having studied for quite some time already, it finally clicked for me how HTML, CSS and JavaScript came together to form a functioning website.  


## Technologies
* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML

## Aim and Functionality
The aim of this website is to translate English into Pig Latin. Once the English is translated into Pig Latin, the user also has the option to reverse translate back into English, copy the given text or start a new translation. This translator uses a Regular Expression that I created myself and spent a lot of time trying to perfect. The main difficulties were when the user inputs symbols and capital letters. I was able to get pretty close to solving the main issues I encountered, for example:
>**_Hey!!!! You talkin' to me, buddy!?!_**

would consider the symbol location/quantity and translate to

>**_Eyhay!!!! Ouyay alkintay' otay emay, uddybay!?!_**
	

## Developement Process
### Design
I chose to keep things simple with this website as it's main purpose was to learn and improve coding. Even so, I still created the visual image of the pig myself (process below) and created a basic layout and colour scheme before moving ahead with coding the visual aspects of the site.

### Needed Improvements
As can be expected, the site could be improved in many ways. It could have added functionality, for example:
- Translating directly from Pig Latin to English.
- Allowing the user to specify the translation rules, as often people prefer to use different word endings.
- Better handle the use of multiple or random capital letters in a word, as my current solution is to convert these situations to sentence case or lower case.

The media queries need to be updated/improved and considerations need to be made for mobile browsers that have extra search bars etc that affect viewport dimensions. Although it would be nice to include these improvements, I don't believe it is necessary to spent time on it currently as the project served it's purpose in my coding journey. Perhaps I'll get to it on a rainy day :could-with-rain:.
